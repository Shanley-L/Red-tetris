## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/red-tetris.git
    cd red-tetris
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    Open a terminal at the root of the project and run:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**

    You need to run two commands in parallel in two separate terminals.

    -   **Terminal 1: Start the server**
        ```sh
        npm start
        ```

    -   **Terminal 2: Start the client**
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```

4.  **Open the application:**

    Your browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:8080` (or a similar address). If not, open your browser and navigate to that URL.
